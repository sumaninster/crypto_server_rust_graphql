GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs, developed by Facebook in 2012 and released as an open-source project in 2015. It provides a more flexible and efficient alternative to the traditional REST API, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need and nothing more.

Some key features and concepts of GraphQL include:

Strongly-typed schema: GraphQL APIs are based on a strongly-typed schema that defines the types, queries, and mutations available. This schema serves as a contract between the client and the server, allowing for better validation, introspection, and auto-generated documentation.
Queries: Clients send queries to request data from a GraphQL API. Queries specify the fields, relationships, and data requirements, giving the client fine-grained control over the data returned in the response.
Mutations: In GraphQL, mutations are used to modify data on the server, such as creating, updating, or deleting records. Like queries, mutations allow clients to specify the data they want to receive in the response.
Resolvers: On the server-side, resolvers are functions responsible for fetching or modifying the requested data. Each field in the schema has a corresponding resolver that knows how to obtain or update the data for that field.
Single endpoint: Unlike REST APIs, which usually have multiple endpoints for different resources and actions, GraphQL APIs typically have a single endpoint that handles all queries and mutations. This simplifies the client's interaction with the API and reduces the overhead of managing multiple endpoints.
Benefits of GraphQL:

Reduced over-fetching: Clients request only the data they need, minimizing the amount of unnecessary data transferred between the client and server.
Efficient aggregation: GraphQL makes it easy to fetch data from multiple resources in a single request, reducing the number of round-trips needed to retrieve all the data.
Better client-server collaboration: The strongly-typed schema enforces a clear contract between the client and server, making it easier for teams to collaborate and understand each other's requirements.
Strong tooling and ecosystem: GraphQL has a rich ecosystem of libraries, tools, and services that make it easy to implement, maintain, and consume GraphQL APIs.
However, GraphQL is not a one-size-fits-all solution, and there are cases where REST APIs or other technologies may be more suitable. It is essential to evaluate the specific requirements and constraints of a project to determine the best approach for designing and building an API.
